# Verification

Run commands in `AGENTS.md`. CI must check Rust fmt/clippy/tests, WASM build, TypeScript, static build, native/WASM agreement and browser smoke. Deployment and functional acceptance are separate from CI.

Adversarial coverage must include arithmetic overflow/division, recursion/fuel, nesting/source size, malformed and unsupported syntax, output/allocation limits, transitive impurity, empty/range limits, exact finite case semantics, stale ghosts, unrelated vs transitive dependency changes, Stop/error UI, fresh default Agent docs and safe text rendering. Never treat a compile-only WASM build as interface verification.

Results will be recorded with the exact revision and remaining gaps before handoff. No Docker required.
